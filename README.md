## Alpha Alert!

We are progressively building this solution from a custom ListView pattern that we already use in Xamarin Forms, and as you can't read our mind, you wont know from one week to another where we are going on this. So beware. We are, however, developing on various branches, and commiting approved updates to the master branch, so the master branch can be considered to have better form than the development branches. It's a winding road to Camelot!

This library is designed to facilitate the capacity of lists created by ```HarryHotdog.UI.ListBuilder``` to be used as remotely-driven lightweight lists that originate as serialized JSON or serialized XML, on any of the following platforms, with such lists having the innate capacity to submit collations of themselves, either to local storage for retrieval by a locally loaded list (such as where a locally-loaded list is being used as a menu), or to a remote endpoint, where the response to such a submission is another list of the same ilk.

Associated projects, which are all held together by the [Yatter API](https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth/Yatter), are as follows:

- [Yatter.UI.ListBuilder](https://github.com/YatterOfficial/Yatter.UI.ListBuilder)
- [Yatter.UI.Blazor.Components](https://github.com/YatterOfficial/Yatter.UI.Blazor.Components)
- [Yatter.Http](https://github.com/YatterOfficial/Yatter.Http)

### Subscript.

The following XML root tag is inevitable:

- &lt;yatter /&gt;

It comes from the 'Y' (meaning _yatter_) component of our HARRY API, which stands for ```Highly Atomic Readily Reactive Yatter``` where yatter means _to chatter_.

This actually describes the request/response conversation of our highly atomic, readily reactive, lists!

_Yatter is so powerful that we expect that in time, the whole HARRY API that is around yatter will come to be known as Yatter!_
